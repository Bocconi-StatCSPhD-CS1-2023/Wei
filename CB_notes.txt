* Good project. Limitations:
  * Not very polished
  * Not very optimizied (explicitly stated in the README)
    - How does the SHA3 implementation compare with the Julia one (on the parts that are comparable)?
  * Are there any other implementations around that we may compare with?
* Notes:
  * Julia naming style:
    * modules normally use CamelCase names (e.g. Lattice, not lattice)
    * function normally use underscores (e.g. get_random_prime, not getRandomPrime)
  * See some comments in the files
