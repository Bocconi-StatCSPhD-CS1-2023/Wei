This is the prototype implementation of my course project. My goal is to implement a few well-known cryptographic primitives based LWE/ringLWE. I don't claim anything about the security of the implementation. The code is divided into three parts: arithmetic over finite field, LWE, cryptographic primitives. At the moment, they are in three files. After I finished an initial basic implementation, I will refactor them into three different packages.
