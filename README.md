My goal is to implement a few well-known cryptographic primitives based on relatively modern assumptions, including pairing, lattice, etc. This project is for educational use. Thus, concept and clarity matter more than practicality. I don't claim anything about the practical security or efficiency of the implementation. 

For the course project, I will focus on lattice-based primitives.
